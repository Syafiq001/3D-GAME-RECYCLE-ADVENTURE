<h2>About the project</h2>

The Recycle Adventure project aims to develop an engaging 3D game to teach primary school students the basics of recycling. Through thorough analysis and design, the game will provide an immersive educational experience, catering to the targeted audience's needs. Subsequent testing will ensure the game's effectiveness in conveying recycling knowledge to its intended users.


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

<li>To analyse the basic knowledge of recycling and discover the best method to implement within an educative game.</li>
<li>To design and develop an educative 3D game for primary schoolers on the basics of recycling.</li>
<li>To test the developed educational game with targeted primary school users.</li>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

In Recycling Adventure, players assume the role of David, navigating through various stages with recycling-related objectives. Initially, the goal is to gather recyclable materials like paper, plastic, glass, and aluminium while steering clear of non-recyclable items.

Upon completing each stage, players accumulate points based on their performance, contributing to their total score and potential rank on the leaderboard.
